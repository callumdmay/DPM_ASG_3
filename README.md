# ECSE 211: Assignment 3

This assignment was designed to introduce the concept of a coordinate system, and integrating 
obstacle collision detection with it.

This program has a hardcoded set of coordinates as an input, as well as a tile size which must be set.
The robot will move to the predetermined coordinates in order, while avoiding obstacles using the P-Controller
wall follower algorithm defined in assignment 1
